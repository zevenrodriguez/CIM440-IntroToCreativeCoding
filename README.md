# [New Syllabus](CIM440-IntrotoCreativeCoding-General-Updated.pdf)


The class will be a flip classroom. I will post video lectures or assignments before class and during class we will have office hours. I will be available only through teams. I would like to keep emailing to a minimum to make sure that all questions get answered. If you have general questions, use the general chat. If you have specific questions, feel free to send me a message. Teams has a great feature to do screen sharing, FYI. If you are not available for class due to time zone issues, please reach out to make arrangements.

•	Online lecturers will be available before class
•	Check in periodically for updates on assignments and lectures
•	Office hours during class time
•	Install Teams desktop

# Backing Up Your Work
* Use a cloud service, Onedrive has worked the best for me
  * Careful with cloud services that have online/offline file systems
  * If your files are only saved to the cloud and not your computer unity will have trouble operating correctly
* Sign up for github and use the Github Student Developer Pack https://education.github.com/pack
* You can sign up for Unity Student https://store.unity.com/academic/unity-student allowing you more storage space to upload your projects to Unity Collab
* Download and Install github desktop https://desktop.github.com/
  * On Macs, under the menu option for github desktop, it says install command line tools, make sure you do that.
* In Unity, import the github plugin into your projects
* [I cover all of this stuff in this video](https://miami.zoom.us/rec/play/6cApduus-zI3EoKd4gSDAqctW43vL66sgyUW_fAPzE_hV3UFZFH3Z7QQZuuRuGLM9m5Fw68SfYE4-siv?autoplay=true&startTime=1585236819000)
